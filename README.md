# MashovPlus
Mashov is a platform for school students in Israel to view grades, mail their teachers, and even take online classes. Mashov Plus (aka RMSFM - Remove My Sex From Mashov) is an open-source Chrome extension that lets students change their name and profile picture (locally) in Mashov, choose a theme, and remove the male and female badges from Mashov's online classes system!
